# Dev Notes

- PlaylistSelector/main.py and MusicDownloader/main.py are for terminal usage

- Locations for mobile/PC adjustments:
    - user_inputs.py
    - selector.py
    - KivyUI/main.py

### Ideas
- Make widgets for playlist control
- Find out how to make "tab" work correctly in JSON
- Progress notifications
- Try building via Github

 



## User Notes
- After downloading, the device needs to be restarted for the selector to work.
